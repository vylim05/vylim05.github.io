ðŸŒ¸ I am a freshman (academically a sophomore) at the Univerisity of Pittsburgh 

ðŸŒ¸ I am currently working towards my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science (expected graduation 2026) and earning my Associate Degree in Computer Science (expected graduation 2025).

ðŸŒ¸ I am interested in applying cybersecurity and A.I. in real world scenarios. 

## Experience

Regarding programming languages, I have coded with Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, TypeScript, and Dart.

I have also attended multiple hackathons such as TreeHacks at Stanford University and TartanHacks at Carnegie Mellon University.

With that, I also have worked fullstack but have a love and appreciation for frontend developing.
