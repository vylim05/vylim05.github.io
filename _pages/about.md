ðŸŒ¸ I am a sophomore (academically a junior) at the Univerisity of Pittsburgh 

ðŸŒ¸ I am currently working towards my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science (expected graduation 2026) and earning my Comptia Security+ SYO-701 Certificate. (expected date end of 2024)
ðŸŒ¸ I am interested in applying as a full-stack software developer and cybersecurity.

## Experience

Regarding programming languages, I have coded with Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, TypeScript, and Dart.

I have also attended multiple hackathons such as TreeHacks at Stanford University, TartanHacks at Carnegie Mellon University, and other smaller hackathons within the University of Pittsburgh.

With that, I also have worked fullstack and have a love and appreciation for frontend developing.
